# Type-3-Cytokines-in-UTI

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent infectious diseases. While individual immune cell subsets have been shown to contribute to UTI immunity, intersubset redundancies and synergies among immune cells remain unclear. We performed a temporal characterization of the immune response in a mouse model of UTI using multi-omics analyses and loss-of-function experiments. A dominant type 3 immune signature emerged early in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), γδ-T cells, and CD4+ T cells. Transcriptomic analyses identified γδ-T cells and, to a lesser extent, also ILCs as primary producers of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, and IL-22. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that, whereas type 3 cytokines were essential for infection control, local bacterial burden remained controlled in the absence of individual subsets, including neutrophils, γδ-T cells, and peripheral CD90+ cells. Collectively, we provide a comprehensive study of the dynamic immune landscape during UTI in mice, highlighting the robustness of protective type 3 immunity.
